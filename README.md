# parentcollegecrawler

This is a very basic web crawler that is vibe code generated by Snehal Thakkar to obtain latest college information to help kids make college choices. Currently, I restrict my runs to 3 requests per minute in order to not overload a college. The hope is to take the latest information and feed to either LLM or NotebookLLM in order to get answers to college choice questions more easily. Current LLMs are pretty bad at this because they are trained on obsolete data.
